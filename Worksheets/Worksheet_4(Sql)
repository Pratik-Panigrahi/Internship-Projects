Ans=A Data Warehousing (DW) is process for collecting and managing data from varied sources to provide 
      meaningful business insights. A Data warehouse is typically used to connect and analyze business 
      data from heterogeneous sources. The data warehouse is the core of the BI system which is built for data analysis and reporting.

12. What is the difference between OLTP VS OLAP?
Ans=Online transaction processing (OLTP) captures, stores, and processes data from transactions in real time.

13. What are the various characteristics of data-warehouse?
Ans=There are three prominent data warehouse characteristics:
    •	Integrated: The way data is extracted and transformed is uniform, regardless of the original source.
    •	Time-variant: Data is organized via time-periods (weekly, monthly, annually, etc.).
    •	Non-volatile: A data warehouse is not updated in real-time. It is periodically updated via the uploading of data, protecting it from the influence of momentary change.

14. What is Star-Schema??
Ans=The star schema architecture is the simplest data warehouse schema. It is called a star schema because the diagram resembles a star, with points radiating from a centre.
    The centre of the star consists of fact table and the points of the star are the dimension tables.

15. What do you mean by SETL?
Ans=ETL is short for extract, transform, load, three database functions that are combined into one tool to pull data out of one database and place it into another database. 
    Extract is the process of reading data from a database.
